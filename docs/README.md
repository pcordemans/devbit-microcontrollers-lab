> Lab exercises for the [devbit microcontrollers](https://microcontrollers.netlify.com) course

## Lab approach

1. Build embedded applications using the Nucleo L476RG prototyping board and mbed libraries.
1. Learn the internals of the STM32L476RGT6 microcontroller and program it on the register level.
